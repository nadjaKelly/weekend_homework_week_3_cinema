CodeClan Cinema (CCC (again))
Create a system that handles bookings for our newly built cinema! It's enough if you can call your methods in pry, don't worry about an interface.

Your app should have:
Films

title
director_name
Tickets

film_id
customer_name
Your app should be able to:
Create films and tickets
CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) films and tickets
Show which tickets() have been sold for a film and what film() a ticket is for.
Extensions:
Only if you find time you could -
Review the Many-to-Many solution to the IMDB lab on Thursday
Have a go at the original HW brief in the classnotes
PDA Reminder:
Remember to gather evidence for your PDA this week. This should only take 5 minutes:

Go to your PDA Checklist

Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to your own PDA repo
